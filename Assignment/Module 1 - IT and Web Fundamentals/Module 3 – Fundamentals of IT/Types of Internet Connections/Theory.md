Broadband (General Term)

Definition: Broadband refers to high-speed internet that is always on and faster than old dial-up.

Types included: DSL, Cable, Satellite, Wireless, and Fiber are all forms of broadband.

Technology: Usually uses copper wires (telephone lines for DSL, coaxial cables for Cable).

Speed: Medium to high (from a few Mbps up to 300–500 Mbps depending on type).

Reliability: Can slow down during peak usage times (especially cable).

Fiber-Optic Internet

Definition: A type of broadband that uses thin glass or plastic fibers to transmit data as light.

Technology: Uses fiber-optic cables (light signals instead of electricity).

Speed: Extremely fast (100 Mbps to 1–10 Gbps).

Reliability: Very stable, not affected much by distance or peak usage.

Key Differences

Technology

Broadband (DSL/Cable): Uses copper wires (electrical signals).

Fiber: Uses fiber-optic cables (light signals).

Speed

Broadband: Slower, ranges from a few Mbps to a few hundred Mbps.

Fiber: Much faster, up to gigabit (1,000 Mbps+) speeds.

Reliability

Broadband: Can be affected by distance, interference, and heavy usage.

Fiber: More reliable, less interference, consistent speed.

Availability

Broadband: Widely available in most areas.

Fiber: Limited to cities and growing urban areas.
