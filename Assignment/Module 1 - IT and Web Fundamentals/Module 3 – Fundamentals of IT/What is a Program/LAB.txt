Write a simple "Hello World" program in two different programming languages ofyour choice.
Compare the structure and syntax.


1. C Example :

#include <stdio.h>   

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");  
    return 0;  
}

2. Java Example :

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}

Comparison between C and Java (Hello World Program)

1. Code Structure

C → Procedural (program is built using functions).

Java → Object-Oriented (program must be inside a class).

2. Entry Point

C → Starts execution from int main().

Java → Starts execution from public static void main(String[] args).

3. Printing Syntax

C → Uses printf("Hello, World!\n");.

Java → Uses System.out.println("Hello, World!");.

4. Header / Imports

C → Requires #include <stdio.h> to use printf.

Java → No extra header needed, but a class definition is mandatory.

5. Execution Type

C → Directly compiled into machine code (runs faster, platform-dependent).

Java → Compiled into bytecode which runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) (platform-independent).

6. Code Length

C → Shorter, around 6–7 lines.

Java → More verbose, requires at least 5–6 lines with class and main method.

7. Use Case

C → Used in system programming, operating systems, embedded systems, and low-level hardware control.

Java → Used in application programming, mobile apps (Android), enterprise applications, and cross-platform software.
