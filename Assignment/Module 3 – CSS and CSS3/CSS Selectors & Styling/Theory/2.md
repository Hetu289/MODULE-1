Question 2: Explain the concept of CSS specificity. How do conflicts between multiple stylesget
resolved?

CSS Specificity

CSS Specificity is a set of rules that browsers use to determine which CSS rule applies when multiple rules target the same element.
It helps resolve conflicts between competing styles.

How Specificity Works:

1. Inline styles (highest specificity)
   Example:

<p style="color:red;">Hello</p>  

2. ID selectors (#id) – high specificity
   Example:
   #header {
   color: blue;
   }

3. Class selectors (.class), attribute selectors ([type="text"]), pseudo-classes (:hover) – medium specificity
   Example:
   .highlight {
   color: green;
   }

4. Element selectors (p, h1) and pseudo-elements (::before) – lowest specificity
   Example:
   p {
   color: black;
   }

Conflict Resolution:

* The browser applies the style with higher specificity.
* If two rules have the same specificity, the later one in the CSS file is applied.

Example:

<p id="text" class="highlight" style="color: red;">Hello</p>  
CSS:  
p { color: black; }          /* lowest specificity */  
.highlight { color: green; } /* medium specificity */  
#text { color: blue; }       /* high specificity */  

Result: Text will be red because inline style has the highest specificity.

In short:
Specificity order → Inline > ID > Class/Attribute/Pseudo-class > Element/Pseudo-element.
Later rules override earlier ones if specificity is the same.
