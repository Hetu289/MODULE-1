Rakshabandhan is a traditional Indian festival celebrating the sacred bond between brothers and sisters. Sisters tie a decorative thread called 
<strong>Rakhi</strong> around their brothers’ wrists, praying for their well-being and prosperity. In return, brothers promise to protect them and shower them with gifts.  

Steps to Celebrate Rakshabandhan:

1. <strong>Choose a Rakhi:</strong> Select a beautiful Rakhi thread for your brother.  
2. <strong>Tie the Rakhi:</strong> Sisters tie the Rakhi on their brother’s wrist with love.  
3. <strong>Exchange Gifts:</strong> Brothers give gifts as a token of love and protection.  
4. <strong>Share Sweet Treats:</strong> Family members enjoy traditional sweets together.  
5. <strong>Send Wishes:</strong> If far away, send Rakhi and greetings digitally to celebrate together.
