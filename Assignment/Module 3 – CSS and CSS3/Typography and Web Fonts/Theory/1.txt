Question 1: Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Why might you use a web-safe font over a custom font?

Web-safe fonts:

These are pre-installed fonts that are commonly available on most operating systems (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman, Verdana, Georgia).

They load quickly and are reliably displayed across all browsers and devices.

Custom web fonts:

Fonts that are not pre-installed on devices and are loaded from external sources like Google Fonts or hosted files.

They provide unique and stylish typography but can slightly increase page load time.

Why use web-safe fonts:

Faster loading and better performance.

Guaranteed display on all devices, especially when custom fonts may fail to load.

Simpler fallback and less dependency on external sources.
