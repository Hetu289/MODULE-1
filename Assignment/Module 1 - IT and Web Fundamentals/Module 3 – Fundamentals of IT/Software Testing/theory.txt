Importance of Software Testing

Software testing is a crucial step in the software development process because it ensures that the final product is reliable, efficient, and meets user expectations.

Key reasons why it is important:

Error Detection – Identifies bugs and defects before the software is released.

Quality Assurance – Ensures the software performs as intended under different conditions.

User Satisfaction – Delivers a product that is reliable, user-friendly, and meets requirements.

Cost and Time Saving – Fixing errors early in development is cheaper and faster than after release.

Security – Protects against vulnerabilities that could lead to data breaches or misuse.

Performance Verification – Confirms the software runs efficiently without crashes or slowdowns.
