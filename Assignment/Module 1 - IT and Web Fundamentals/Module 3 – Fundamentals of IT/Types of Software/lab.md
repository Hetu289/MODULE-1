Objective

To create a list of software I use regularly and classify them into System Software, Application Software, and Utility Software.

Steps

Identify the software I use on my computer/mobile daily.

Categorize each software into one of the three types:

System Software (runs the computer hardware and OS).

Application Software (used for performing user tasks).

Utility Software (helps maintain, manage, and protect the system).

Classification

System Software

Windows 11 – Operating system that manages hardware and software resources.

Android (on mobile) – Provides the environment to run mobile apps.

Application Software

MS Word – Used to create and edit documents.

Google Chrome – Web browser for accessing websites.

WhatsApp – Messaging application for communication.

VLC Media Player – Plays audio and video files.

Utility Software

WinRAR – Used to compress and extract files.

Antivirus (e.g., Avast) – Protects the computer from viruses and malware.

Disk Cleanup (Windows) – Helps remove unnecessary files and optimize performance.




System software (like Windows and Android) provides the foundation for running a computer or mobile device.

Application software (like MS Word, Chrome, WhatsApp, VLC) helps users perform tasks such as writing, browsing, communicating, or watching videos.

Utility software (like WinRAR, Antivirus, Disk Cleanup) ensures better system performance, security, and file management.
