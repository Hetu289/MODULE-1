What is a Program ?

A program is a set of instructions written by humans using a programming language (like C, Java, Python, etc.) 
that tells a computer what to do.

How does a Program Function ?

1. Write the Program → 

A programmer writes instructions in a programming language.
Example: print("Hello World")

2. Translate the Program →

Some languages are compiled (like C, Java) → The code is converted into machine code.
Some are interpreted (like Python) → The interpreter reads and runs the code line by line.

3. Execution → The computer’s CPU follows the instructions step by step.

4. Output → The program produces results (like showing text, calculating numbers, controlling hardware, etc.).

Example of How it Works ;

public class AddNumbers {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;          
        int b = 10;         
        int sum = a + b;    
        System.out.println(sum); 
    }
}

Step-by-Step How it Works

public class AddNumbers { ... }

Defines a class named AddNumbers.

In Java, all code must be inside a class.

public static void main(String[] args)

This is the entry point of the program.

The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) starts executing from here.

int a = 5;

A variable named a is created and assigned the value 5.

int b = 10;

Another variable b is created and assigned the value 10.

int sum = a + b;

The computer adds the values of a and b (5 + 10).

The result (15) is stored in a new variable sum.

System.out.println(sum);

The value stored in sum (which is 15) is printed on the screen.

Output : 15
