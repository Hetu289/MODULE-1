Advantages of Using Web Applications over Desktop Applications

No Installation Required – Web apps run directly in a browser, saving storage space and setup time.

Accessibility Anywhere – Can be accessed from any device with internet, supporting remote work.

Cross-Platform Compatibility – Work on Windows, Mac, Linux, or mobile without separate versions.

Easy Maintenance & Updates – Updates are done on the server side, so users always get the latest version automatically.

Cost-Effective – Reduces the need for complex installations and version management across devices.

Collaboration Support – Many web apps allow multiple users to work together in real time (e.g., Google Docs).

Centralized Data Storage – Data is stored in the cloud/server, making it secure and accessible from anywhere.
