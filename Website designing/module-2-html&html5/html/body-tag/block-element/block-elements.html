        WHAT IS BLOCK ELEMENT IN HTML?
=======================================

Block elements in HTML are elements that take up the full width available 
and always start on a new line. 
They create a "block" of content, meaning they stack vertically in the layout.

Block elements can contain other block elements or inline elements. 
They are typically used to structure the layout of a webpage.

They differ from inline elements, which only take up as much width as necessary 
and do not start on a new line.
Examples of inline elements include <span>, <a>, and <img>.

Understanding the difference between block and inline elements 
is important for effective web design and layout management.
