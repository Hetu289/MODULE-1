Three-Tier Software Architecture for a Web Application
1. Presentation Tier (User Interface Layer)

This is the front-end of the application.

It is what the user sees and interacts with.

Built using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, React, Vue.js.

Example: A login page in a web application.

2. Application Tier (Business Logic Layer)

This is the middle layer, also called the logic or service layer.

It processes data between the presentation tier and data tier.

Contains the business rules, logic, and algorithms.

Built with Java, C#, Python, PHP, Node.js, etc.

Example: Validating a userâ€™s login details against stored credentials.

3. Data Tier (Database Layer)

This is the back-end where data is stored, retrieved, and managed.

Uses Databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MongoDB.

Example: Storing user information, product details, or transaction records.

*Example :

User enters login info in Presentation Tier.

Application Tier checks credentials against the database.

Data Tier returns results (success or failure).

Result is sent back to the Presentation Tier to show the user.
