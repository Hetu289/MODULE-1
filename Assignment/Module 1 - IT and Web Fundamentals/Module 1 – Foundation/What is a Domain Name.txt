What is a Domain Name?

A domain name is the human-readable address of a website.

Example: google.com, facebook.com.

Computers use IP addresses (like 142.250.183.206) to identify each other, but these are hard for humans to remember.
Domain names are like nicknames for IP addresses.

Parts of a domain name:
www.example.com
www → Subdomain
example → Domain name
.com → Extension (TLD = Top Level Domain)

Domain names are managed by DNS (Domain Name System) which translates the name into an IP address so browsers can find the correct server.
