Question 1: Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border, margin). How does each affect the size of an element?

The CSS Box Model represents every HTML element as a rectangular box. It has four components:

Content – The area where text, images, or other content appear. Its size is defined by width and height.

Padding – The space between content and border. It increases the total size of the element:
Total width = content width + left padding + right padding
Total height = content height + top padding + bottom padding

Border – The line surrounding the padding. Its thickness adds to the total size:
Total width = content + padding + border
Total height = content + padding + border

Margin – The space outside the border, separating the element from others. It does not affect the element’s internal size but affects spacing around it.

Visual structure :

[ Margin ]
  [ Border ]
    [ Padding ]
      [ Content ]
