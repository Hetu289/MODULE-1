Key Elements of System Design

Architecture Design – Defines the overall structure of the system, including client-server setup, modules, and data flow.

Data Design – Specifies how data will be stored, organized, and accessed using databases or files.

Interface Design – Focuses on user interfaces (UI) and system interfaces that ensure smooth interaction.

Component Design – Breaks the system into smaller modules or components with clear responsibilities.

Security Design – Ensures authentication, authorization, and protection of sensitive data.

Performance Design – Considers speed, scalability, and resource optimization for efficiency.

Reliability and Fault Tolerance – Plans for error handling, backup, and recovery mechanisms.

Integration Design – Defines how different modules, external systems, or third-party services will connect.
