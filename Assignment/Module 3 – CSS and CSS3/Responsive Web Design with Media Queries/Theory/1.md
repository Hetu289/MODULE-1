Question 1: What are media queries in CSS, and why are they important for responsive design?

Media queries are a CSS technique used to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device or screen, such as width, height, resolution, or orientation.

They are essential for responsive design, allowing webpages to adapt to different screen sizes like desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Using media queries, designers can change layouts, font sizes, colors, or visibility of elements depending on the device.

Example use cases:

Adjusting navigation menus for mobile screens.

Changing font sizes for readability on small devices.

Hiding or showing content depending on screen size.
