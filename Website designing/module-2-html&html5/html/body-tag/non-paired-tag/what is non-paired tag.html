Non-Paired Tags in HTML

Definition:
Non-paired tags (also called self-closing or void tags) are HTML tags that do not require a closing tag. They are used to insert elements that do not enclose content, such as line breaks, images, or meta information.

Examples of Non-Paired Tags:

<meta> – Defines metadata about the document (like charset, viewport, or description).

<link> – Used to link external resources like CSS files.

<br> – Inserts a line break.

<img> – Displays an image.

<input> – Creates form input fields.

<hr> – Inserts a horizontal rule or divider.

Notes:

These tags don’t have closing tags.

In XHTML or modern HTML5, some of these can be written with a slash like <br /> or <img />, but it is optional in HTML5.
