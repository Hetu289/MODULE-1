Key Steps in the Programming Process

1. Problem Understanding / Requirement Analysis

   * First, understand **what the problem is** and **what needs to be solved**.
   * Example: If the task is to create a calculator, decide what operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) it should perform.


2. Planning the Solution (Algorithm / Flowchart)

   * Break the problem into **logical steps**.
   * You can write an **algorithm** (step-by-step instructions) or draw a **flowchart**.
   * Example: To add two numbers → Step 1: Input two numbers → Step 2: Add them → Step 3: Show result.


3. Writing the Program (Coding)

   * Convert the plan into actual code using a programming language like **C, Java, Python, etc.**
   * Example: Writing `sum = a + b` in code.


4. Compiling / Translating the Program

   * Code is converted into **machine language** that the computer understands.
   * In compiled languages (C, Java) → Compiler is used.
   * In interpreted languages (Python) → Interpreter runs the code line by line.


5. Testing & Debugging

   * Run the program and check if it works correctly.
   * If errors (bugs) occur, fix them (debugging).
   * Example: If you accidentally wrote `sum = a - b`, you correct it to `sum = a + b`.


6. Execution / Output Verification

   * Run the final program and check if the output matches the requirements
   * Example: Adding `5 + 10` should give `15`.


7. Documentation & Maintenance

   * Write comments or documentation so others (or you in the future) understand the code.
   * Update or improve the program when requirements change.


Example in Real Life

Suppose you want to program a Digital Clock:

1. Understand the need → It should show hours, minutes, seconds.
2. Plan → Decide steps (get system time → format it → display).
3. Write code in Java/Python.
4. Compile and run.
5. Test → Check if time updates every second.
6. Fix errors if clock doesn’t update.
7. Maintain → Add features later (like alarm).


In short:
The programming process = Understand → Plan → Code → Translate → Test → Run → Maintain.
