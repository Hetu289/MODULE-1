What is Software Requirements Specification (SRS)?

Definition:
- SRS is a document that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. It outlines functional and non-functional requirements, constraints, and interfaces for a software system.

Types of SRS:

1. Functional Requirements:
    - Definition: Specify what the system should do, the features and functions.
    - Example: "The system shall allow users to log in using a username and password."

2. Non-Functional Requirements:
    - Definition: Specify how the system performs a function, including quality attributes.
    - Example: "The system shall respond to user queries within 2 seconds."

3. Interface Requirements:
    - Definition: Describe how the system interacts with other systems or hardware.
    - Example: "The system shall communicate with the payment gateway via REST API."

4. Performance Requirements:
    - Definition: Specify performance criteria such as speed, capacity, and reliability.
    - Example: "The system shall support up to 1000 concurrent users."

5. Security Requirements:
    - Definition: Specify security constraints and measures.
    - Example: "The system shall encrypt all user data using AES-256."

6. Usability Requirements:
    - Definition: Specify user experience and ease of use.
    - Example: "The system shall provide a help section accessible from every page."

7. Reliability Requirements:
    - Definition: Specify the ability of the system to operate without failure.
    - Example: "The system shall have 99.9% uptime."

Summary:
- SRS is essential for clear communication between stakeholders and developers.
- It helps ensure the software meets user needs and expectations.
