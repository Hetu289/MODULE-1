What is a CSS Selector?

A CSS selector is a pattern used to select and style specific HTML elements on a webpage.
It tells the browser which HTML element(s) the CSS rules should apply to.

Types of CSS Selectors with Examples:

1. Element Selector:
   Selects HTML elements directly by their tag name.
   Example:
   p {
   color: blue;
   }
   (This changes all <p> elements’ text color to blue.)

2. Class Selector:
   Selects elements that have a specific class name (starts with a dot .).
   Example:
   .highlight {
   background-color: yellow;
   }
   (This applies yellow background to elements with class="highlight".)

3. ID Selector:
   Selects one specific element with a unique ID (starts with a hash #).
   Example:
   #header {
   font-size: 24px;
   color: red;
   }
   (This applies red text and large font to the element with id="header".)

In short:
Element → p { }
Class → .classname { }
ID → #idname { }
