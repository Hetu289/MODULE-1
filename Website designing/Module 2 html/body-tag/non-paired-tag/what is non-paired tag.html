Non-Paired Tags ?

Non-paired tags are HTML elements that do not require a closing tag. They are self-contained and do not have any content between an opening and closing tag, as they only need to be defined once. Examples of non-paired tags include `<img>`, `<br>`, `<hr>`, and `<input>`. These tags are typically used for inserting images, line breaks, horizontal rules, and form inputs, respectively.
Non-paired tags are essential for structuring HTML documents and enhancing user experience without the need for additional closing tags. They help keep the code clean and concise, making it easier to read and maintain.

A non-paired tag (also called empty tag or self-closing tag) is an HTML tag that does not require a closing tag.
It is used only as a single tag because it does not wrap any content inside it.

Examples of Non-Paired Tags:

<meta> → defines metadata about the HTML document

<link> → links external files like CSS

<br> → inserts a line break

<hr> → inserts a horizontal line

<img> → displays an image

<input> → creates an input field
