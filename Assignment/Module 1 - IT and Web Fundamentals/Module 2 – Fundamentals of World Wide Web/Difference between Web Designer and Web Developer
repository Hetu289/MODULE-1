Difference between Web Designer and Web Developer.

Web Designer:

Focuses on the look and feel of a website.
Works on UI/UX (User Interface & User Experience).
Uses tools like Photoshop, Figma, Canva and languages like HTML, CSS (basic).
Ensures the site is attractive, responsive, and user-friendly.
Example: Choosing colors, layouts, fonts, button designs.

Web Developer:

Focuses on the functionality and logic of a website.
Works on coding and programming.
Uses languages like JavaScript, PHP, Python, Java, Node.js, etc.
Ensures the site is working properly (forms, database, login systems, e-commerce, etc.).
Example: Making a login system, shopping cart, or data storage.

In short:
Designer = “How it looks” (Front-end visual design)
Developer = “How it works” (Coding + Backend functionality)
