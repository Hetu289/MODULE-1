Question 1: Define HTML. What is the purpose of HTML in web development?

Answer:
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the content and layout of a webpage using various tags and elements.

Purpose in Web Development: HTML provides the basic framework for websites, allowing text, images, links, forms, and multimedia to be displayed in browsers. It works together with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity) to build complete web applications.

Question 2: Explain the basic structure of an HTML document. Identify the mandatory tags and their purposes.

Answer:
A basic HTML document has the following structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Page Title</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Content goes here</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html> → Declares the document type (HTML5).

<html> → Root element that contains the entire webpage.

<head> → Holds metadata (title, styles, scripts, SEO information).

<title> → Defines the title shown on the browser tab.

<body> → Contains all the visible content like text, images, and links.

These tags form the mandatory foundation of every HTML page.

Question 3: What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in HTML? Provide examples of each.

Answer:

Block-level elements:

Always start on a new line.

Occupy the full width available.

Used for structuring content.

Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1>, <ul>, <table>.

Inline elements:

Do not start on a new line.

Only take up as much width as necessary.

Used for styling or formatting within text.

Examples: <span>, <a>, <img>, <strong>, <em>.

Question 4: Discuss the role of semantic HTML. Why is it important for accessibility and SEO? Provide examples of semantic elements.

Answer:
Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags that describe the purpose of content, rather than just its appearance.

Importance:

Accessibility: Helps screen readers and assistive technologies understand the content, improving usability for disabled users.

SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Search engines use semantic elements to better understand the page structure, improving ranking and visibility.

Clarity: Makes the code easier to read and maintain.

Examples of Semantic Elements:

<header> → Defines the page or section header.

<nav> → Represents navigation menus.

<article> → Independent piece of content (e.g., blog post).

<section> → Groups related content.

<footer> → Defines the page or section footer.
