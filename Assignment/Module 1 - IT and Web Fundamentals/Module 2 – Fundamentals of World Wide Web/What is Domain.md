What is Domain?

A Domain is the unique name that identifies a website on the internet.

Example: www.example.com

It replaces complex IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) with human-readable names.

A domain always has:

Name (example)

Extension (.com, .org, .net, .in, etc.)

Without a domain, users would need to remember IP addresses.
