Ganesh Chaturthi is one of the most beloved and widely celebrated festivals in India. It marks the birth of Lord Ganesha, the remover of obstacles, the god of wisdom, prosperity, and new beginnings. 
On this auspicious day, beautifully crafted idols of Lord Ganesha are installed in homes and public pandals, decorated with flowers, lights, and vibrant themes. Devotees offer prayers, chant mantras, and sing aartis with great devotion, filling the air with divine energy.  
<br><br>
Modaks, ladoos, and other sweets, which are considered Lord Ganesha’s favorite, are prepared and offered as prasad. The celebration continues for days with music, dance, and cultural programs. On the final day, the grand visarjan (immersion) takes place, where devotees bid farewell to Lord Ganesha with chants of <b>“Ganpati Bappa Morya”</b>, carrying the spirit of hope, unity, and positivity for the year ahead.
