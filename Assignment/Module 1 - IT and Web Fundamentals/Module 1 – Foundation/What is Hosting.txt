What is Hosting?

Hosting is a service that provides storage space and resources on a web server to make your website accessible on the internet.

When you create a website, all files (HTML, CSS, images, databases) need to be stored on a server that is connected to the internet.

Hosting companies (like Hostinger, Bluehost, GoDaddy, etc.) rent or sell this server space.

Types of hosting:

Shared Hosting – Many websites on one server (cheap, but limited).
VPS Hosting – Virtual Private Server, better performance.
Dedicated Hosting – One full server for one client (expensive, powerful).
Cloud Hosting – Uses multiple servers (scalable, reliable).

Without hosting, your website files would just sit on your computer and wouldn’t be visible to the world.
