Types of Programming Languages :

Programming languages are used to give instructions to a computer. They can be categorized based on their level of abstraction, purpose, and style.

1. Low-Level Languages :

Closer to machine language, very hard for humans but fast for computers.

Machine Language :

Written in binary (0s and 1s).

Directly understood by the CPU.

Example: 10110000 01100001

Very difficult for humans to write.

Assembly Language :

Uses short codes (mnemonics) instead of 0s and 1s.

Needs an assembler to convert to machine code.

Example: 

MOV A, 5
ADD A, 10

2. High-Level Languages

Easier for humans, closer to natural language. Need a compiler/interpreter.

Procedural Languages

Programs are built around functions and procedures.

Example: C, Pascal, Fortran

Object-Oriented Languages (OOP)

Programs are built using classes and objects.

Example: Java, C++, C#, Python

Scripting Languages

Usually interpreted, used for automation and web scripting.

Example: Python, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby

Functional Languages

Focus on mathematical functions instead of step-by-step instructions.

Example: Haskell, Lisp, Scala

3. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs)

Designed for a particular task.

SQL → For databases.

HTML, CSS → For web development.

MATLAB → For mathematical & scientific computing.

4. Markup & Query Languages (not true programming, but important)

HTML, XML → Structure of web documents.

SQL → Querying databases.
