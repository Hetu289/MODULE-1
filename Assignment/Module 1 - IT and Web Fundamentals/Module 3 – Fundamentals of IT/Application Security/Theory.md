1. Role of Encryption in Securing Applications
What is Encryption?

Encryption is the process of converting plain text into unreadable ciphertext using algorithms and keys, so only authorized users can read the data.

Role in Security:

Data Confidentiality → Ensures sensitive data (passwords, credit card info, messages) cannot be read by attackers.

Data Integrity → Prevents tampering of data during transmission.

Authentication → Confirms that the sender/receiver is legitimate (e.g., digital certificates).

Secure Communication → Protects information exchanged between client and server (e.g., HTTPS, VPNs).

Example:
When you log in to an online banking app, your username & password are encrypted before being sent across the internet.
