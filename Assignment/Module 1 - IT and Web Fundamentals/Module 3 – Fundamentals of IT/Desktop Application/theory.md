Pros and Cons of Desktop Applications vs Web Applications

Pros of Desktop Applications:

Performance – Usually faster as they run directly on the operating system.

Offline Access – Can work without internet connectivity.

Better Hardware Integration – Easy access to local resources (files, printers, USB devices).

Security Control – Data can be stored locally, giving more control over privacy.

Cons of Desktop Applications:

Installation Required – Must be installed on every machine before use.

Platform Dependency – Separate versions may be needed for Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

Updates – Users need to download and install updates manually (unless auto-update is built in).

Limited Accessibility – Can only be used on the device where it’s installed.
