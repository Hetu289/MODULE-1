1. Types of Software Environments

Development Environment

Used by programmers to write and build code.

Contains IDEs (like Eclipse, VS Code), compilers, and debugging tools.

Example: A developer writing and testing a Java program locally.

Testing Environment

Used by QA teams to test applications before release.

Ensures the software works correctly under different scenarios.

Example: Running unit tests, integration tests, or system tests.

Production Environment

The live environment where actual users interact with the application.

Must be stable, secure, and high-performing.

Example: A real e-commerce website serving customers.

2. Lab Task: Setting Up a Basic Environment in a Virtual Machine

Tools Required

VirtualBox / VMware

ISO file of an OS (e.g., Ubuntu or Windows)

Steps

Install VirtualBox/VMware on your system.

Create a new Virtual Machine (VM):

Select OS type (e.g., Ubuntu Linux).

Allocate RAM (2–4 GB) and storage (20 GB).

Mount ISO and Install OS inside the VM.

Set Up Development Tools:

Install an editor (VS Code).

Install programming languages (Java, Python, C as required).

Set Up Testing Tools:

Install testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit for Java).

Simulate Production Setup:

Run a simple web server (e.g., Apache or Tomcat).

Deploy a sample “Hello World” web application.

3. Example Output

Development: Writing a Java program in VS Code.

Testing: Running the program with JUnit test cases.

Production: Deploying the program on Apache Tomcat and accessing it via browser (http://localhost:8080).
