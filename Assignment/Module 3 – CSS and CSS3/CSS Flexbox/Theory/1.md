Question 1: What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms flex-container and flex-item.

CSS Flexbox is a layout model that allows elements to be arranged efficiently in a row or column, even when the size of the elements is unknown or dynamic.

It makes responsive design easier and helps align, space, and distribute elements within a container.

Flex-container: The parent element that has display: flex; or display: inline-flex;. It defines the flexible context for its children.

Flex-item: The direct child elements inside a flex-container that can be positioned, aligned, and sized flexibly.
