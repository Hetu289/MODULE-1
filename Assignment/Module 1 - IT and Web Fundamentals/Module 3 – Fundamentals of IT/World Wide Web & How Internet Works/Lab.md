Roles of Client and Server in Web Communication

1. Client

Who it is:
The client is usually a web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) or a mobile app on the user’s device.

Role:

Initiates the communication by sending a request to the server.

Requests resources such as web pages, images, videos, or data.

Displays the server’s response to the user (e.g., rendering HTML into a webpage).

Example:
When you type www.google.com in your browser, your computer (the client) sends a request to Google’s server.

2. Server

Who it is:
A powerful computer (or a group of computers) that stores websites, databases, and services.

Role:

Listens for requests from clients.

Processes the request (e.g., checks database, runs code, retrieves files).

Sends back the correct response (HTML, JSON, images, etc.).

Example:
Google’s web server receives your request, finds the search page, and sends it back to your browser.

Simple Flow

Client (Browser/User Device) → sends request → Server
Server → processes request & sends response → Client

Everyday Example :

You (client) walk into a restaurant and order food.

The waiter (client request) tells the kitchen (server) what you want.

The kitchen (server) prepares your dish and gives it back.

The waiter (client) brings it to your table so you can eat (see the result).
