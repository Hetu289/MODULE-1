Question 1: Explain the structure of an HTML table and the purpose of each of the following elements: <table>, <tr>, <th>, <td>, and <thead>.

Answer:

An HTML table is used to display data in a tabular format, organized in rows and columns. Tables are structured using different HTML elements that define the table, rows, headers, and cells.

<table> → The container element that defines the start and end of the table. All rows and cells are placed inside this element.

<tr> (Table Row) → Defines a single row in the table. Every row of data is wrapped in a <tr> element.

<th> (Table Header) → Represents a header cell in a table. Text inside <th> is usually bold and centered by default. Header cells describe the content of the columns or rows.

<td> (Table Data) → Represents a standard data cell in the table. Each <td> is placed inside a <tr> and contains the actual data.

<thead> (Table Head) → Groups the header content of the table. It is used to separate the table’s header rows from the body (<tbody>), making the table more organized and accessible.

Example of a simple HTML table:

<table border="1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Age</th>
      <th>City</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Ravi</td>
      <td>20</td>
      <td>Delhi</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Priya</td>
      <td>22</td>
      <td>Mumbai</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Question 2: What is the difference between colspan and rowspan in tables? Provide examples.

Answer:

In HTML tables, colspan and rowspan are attributes used to make a single cell span across multiple columns or rows, respectively.

colspan (Column Span):

Extends a table cell across multiple columns.

Useful when a header or cell needs to cover several columns in the same row.

Example:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th colspan="2">Full Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ravi Kumar</td>
    <td>Sharma</td>
    <td>20</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Explanation: The header cell “Full Name” spans two columns, covering first and last name.

rowspan (Row Span):

Extends a table cell across multiple rows.

Useful when the same data applies to multiple rows in the table.

Example:

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <th rowspan="2">Name</th>
    <th>Subject</th>
    <th>Marks</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Math</td>
    <td>90</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Science</td>
    <td>85</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Explanation: The “Name” cell spans two rows, applying to both subject rows.

Question 3: Why should tables be used sparingly for layout purposes? What is a better alternative?

Answer:

Reason to avoid using tables for layout:

Not semantically correct: Tables are meant to display tabular data, not to control page layout. Using them for layout can confuse screen readers and assistive technologies.

Difficult to maintain: Complex table layouts are harder to update or modify compared to modern layout techniques.

Poor responsiveness: Table-based layouts do not adapt well to different screen sizes, making them unsuitable for mobile-friendly websites.

Slower page load: Large, nested tables can increase HTML size and slow down page rendering.

Better alternative:

Use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for layout and styling.

CSS provides techniques like Flexbox, Grid, and positioning, which create responsive, maintainable, and semantically correct designs.

Example:
Instead of using a table for two-column layout:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Sidebar</td>
    <td>Main Content</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Use CSS Flexbox:

<div style="display: flex;">
  <div style="flex: 1; background: #f4f4f4;">Sidebar</div>
  <div style="flex: 3; background: #fff;">Main Content</div>
</div>
