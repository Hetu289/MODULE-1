Introduction

In software architecture, a layered approach means dividing the system into different levels (layers), where each layer has a specific responsibility. Common layers include Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, and Data Layer.

Importance of Layers

Separation of Concerns

Each layer has its own task (UI, logic, or data).

This avoids mixing responsibilities and makes the system easier to manage.

Maintainability

If something changes in one layer (like the database), the other layers are not heavily affected.

Easier to update or fix parts of the system.

Reusability

A layer (like authentication or payment module) can be reused across different applications.

Scalability

Layers can be scaled independently (e.g., database server upgraded without changing UI).

Testability

Each layer can be tested separately (unit testing).

Makes debugging and error fixing simpler.

Security

Sensitive operations can be restricted to certain layers (e.g., database layer handles queries securely).

Example

In an E-commerce Application:

Presentation Layer → Customer browses products.

Business Logic Layer → Applies discount rules and processes orders.

Data Layer → Stores product details, customer info, and transactions.

If the database system is changed from MySQL to Oracle, only the data layer needs modification; UI and business logic remain unaffected.
