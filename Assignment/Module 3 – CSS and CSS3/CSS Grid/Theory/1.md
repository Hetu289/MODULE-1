Question 1: Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over Flexbox?

CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for the web. It allows you to arrange elements in rows and columns simultaneously, unlike Flexbox which is primarily one-dimensional (row or column).

Difference from Flexbox:

Flexbox: Best for linear layouts (single row or column).

Grid: Best for complex, two-dimensional layouts with both rows and columns.

When to use Grid:

When you need precise control over both rows and columns.

For page layouts, galleries, dashboards, or any structure where elements span multiple rows or columns.
