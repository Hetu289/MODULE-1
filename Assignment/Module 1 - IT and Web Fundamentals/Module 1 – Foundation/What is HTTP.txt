What is HTTP ?

HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.

It is the protocol used for communication between a web browser (client) and a web server.

When you type a website URL (like http://example.com) in your browser, HTTP defines how the request (from browser) and response (from server) should be sent and received.

It is a stateless protocol, meaning each request is independent and does not remember previous requests.

Example: If you request a webpage, your browser sends an HTTP Request, and the server replies with an HTTP Response (containing HTML, CSS, images, etc.).

Modern websites mostly use HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which is HTTP with encryption (SSL/TLS) for security.
