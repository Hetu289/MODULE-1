HTTP vs. HTTPS

1. Meaning

HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):
Standard protocol for communication between a web browser (client) and a web server.
Example: http://example.com

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure):
Secure version of HTTP. It uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data during transfer.
Example: https://example.com

2. Security

HTTP:
 Data is sent in plain text, so it can be intercepted by hackers (e.g., passwords, credit card info).

HTTPS:
 Data is encrypted using SSL/TLS, making it safe from eavesdropping or tampering.

3. Port Number

HTTP: Uses port 80 by default.

HTTPS: Uses port 443 by default.

4. Certificates

HTTP: Does not require any certificate.

HTTPS: Requires an SSL/TLS certificate issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

 5. SEO & Browser Impact

HTTP:

Modern browsers mark HTTP sites as “Not Secure.”

Lower ranking on search engines (Google prefers HTTPS).

HTTPS:

Shows a padlock icon  in the browser.

Boosts SEO ranking and increases user trust.

 6. Speed

HTTP: Slightly faster because no encryption/decryption is needed.

HTTPS: A little overhead due to encryption, but with modern hardware/CDNs, speed difference is minimal.
