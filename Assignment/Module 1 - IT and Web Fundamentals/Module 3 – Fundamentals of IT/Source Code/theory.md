Difference between Source Code and Machine Code

Source Code

Source code is the human-readable set of instructions written by a programmer in a programming language (e.g., C, Java, Python).

It is easy for humans to read, write, and understand.

Example:

printf("Hello, World!");

Machine Code

Machine code is the binary code (0s and 1s) that the computer’s processor understands directly.

It is generated from source code after compilation or interpretation.

Example:

01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00101100 00100000 01010111 01101111 01110010 01101100 01100100 00100001

Key Differences

Readability → Source code is human-readable, while machine code is only understood by computers.

Form → Source code is written in high-level languages; machine code is in binary (0s and 1s).

Execution → Source code cannot run directly; it must be converted into machine code. Machine code executes directly on hardware.

Portability → Source code can run on multiple platforms (after compilation), but machine code is platform-specific.
