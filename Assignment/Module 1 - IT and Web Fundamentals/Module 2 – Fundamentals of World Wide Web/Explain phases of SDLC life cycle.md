Phases of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

SDLC has 7 main phases:

1. Planning

In this phase, the objective of the project is decided. Feasibility, budget, and resources are discussed.

Example:
Suppose a company wants to build a Food Delivery App like Zomato.
Planning includes:
Who are the users? (restaurants, customers, delivery persons)
What is the budget?
What features are needed? (ordering food, tracking delivery, payments).

2. Requirement Analysis

Collect detailed requirements from stakeholders (clients, users, managers).
Includes functional requirements (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (speed, security, reliability).

Example:
For the Food Delivery App:
Customers can search restaurants, order food, make payments.
Restaurants can manage menus & receive orders.
Admin can control users and transactions.

3. System Design

Prepare blueprints of the system:
High-level design (HLD): Overall architecture.
Low-level design (LLD): Database design, user interface design, APIs, etc.

Example:
Database tables for Users, Orders, Payments, Restaurants.
UI/UX mockups of home page, cart page, payment screen.
Decide technology: Mobile app (Android/iOS), Backend (Node.js, MySQL).

4. Development (Coding)

Programmers start writing the actual code according to design.
Uses programming languages, frameworks, and tools.

Example:
Developers write code for Login system, Search function, Order placement, Payment gateway integration.
Mobile app developers build Android/iOS apps, backend developers build APIs & databases.

5. Testing

The developed software is tested for bugs, errors, and quality issues.
Types: Unit Testing, Integration Testing, User Acceptance Testing (UAT).

Example:
Check if orders are placed correctly.
Verify if payment works securely.
Test if delivery tracking updates in real-time.
Fix bugs before release.

6. Implementation / Deployment

After successful testing, the software is launched for users.
Can be released in stages (Beta launch, Final release).

Example:
The Food Delivery App is uploaded to Google Play Store & Apple App Store.
Restaurants and users start using it.

7. Maintenance

After deployment, software requires regular updates, bug fixing, and new features.

Example:
Adding new payment methods (UPI, Wallets).
Fixing bugs in order tracking.
Adding a discount/coupon system later.

Inshort with Example (Food Delivery App)

Planning → Decide to make a food app like Zomato.
Analysis → Collect requirements (ordering, payments, tracking).
Design → Database, UI mockups, tech stack.
Development → Coding app + backend.
Testing → Check order, payment, tracking works.
Deployment → Launch on Play Store/App Store.
Maintenance → Fix bugs, add new features.
