Question 1: Difference b/w HTML & HTML5?

Difference Between HTML and HTML5

1. Definition:
   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is used to create and structure web pages.
   HTML5 is the latest version of HTML that adds new features for multimedia, graphics, and responsive design without external plugins.

2. Multimedia Support:
   HTML required plugins like Flash for video and audio.
   HTML5 provides built-in `<audio>` and `<video>` tags to play media directly.

3. Graphics and Animations:
   HTML had no direct support for graphics or animations.
   HTML5 introduced `<canvas>` and `<svg>` elements for drawing graphics and creating animations.

4. Storage Options:
   HTML only used cookies to store data.
   HTML5 added localStorage and sessionStorage for faster and safer data storage.

5. Form Enhancements:
   HTML had limited form controls.
   HTML5 added new input types like email, date, number, range, and attributes like required, placeholder, autofocus, and pattern for better validation.

6. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):
   HTML had very few APIs.
   HTML5 introduced powerful APIs like Geolocation, Drag and Drop, Web Workers, WebSocket, and Offline Storage.

7. Doctype Declaration:
   HTML used a long and complex doctype declaration.
   HTML5 uses a short and simple one: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.

8. Mobile and Responsive Design:
   HTML was not mobile-friendly.
   HTML5 supports responsive design with the viewport meta tag and works well with CSS3.

9. Error Handling:
   HTML required strict syntax and could break with small errors.
   HTML5 is more flexible and handles small syntax errors automatically.

10. Semantic Elements:
    HTML used only <div> and <span> for structure.
    HTML5 introduced new semantic tags like <header>, <footer>, <section>, <article>, <nav>, and <main> for better readability and SEO.
