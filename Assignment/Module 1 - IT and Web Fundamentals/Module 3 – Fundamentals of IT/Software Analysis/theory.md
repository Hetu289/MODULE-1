Role of Software Analysis in the Development Process

Software analysis is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that focuses on understanding and defining what the software should achieve before actual design and coding begin.

Key roles include:

Requirement Understanding – Analyzes client and user needs to ensure the system will solve the right problem.

Feasibility Study – Evaluates whether the project is technically, financially, and operationally possible.

Defining Specifications – Converts user needs into clear, detailed, and structured requirements.

Minimizing Errors – Detects inconsistencies, ambiguities, or missing requirements early.

Foundation for Design – Provides the blueprint for system architecture and detailed design.

Risk Reduction – Identifies potential challenges before development starts, reducing project failure chances.
