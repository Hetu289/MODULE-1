Differences Between Native and Hybrid Mobile Apps

Platform Dependency

Native Apps: Built specifically for one platform (Android or iOS) using platform-specific languages (Java/Kotlin for Android, Swift/Objective-C for iOS).

Hybrid Apps: Built using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and run inside a native container, so they can work on multiple platforms.

Performance

Native Apps: Faster and more responsive since they directly use device hardware and APIs.

Hybrid Apps: Slightly slower due to reliance on a web view or bridge between code and device.

User Experience (UX/UI)

Native Apps: Provide a better, platform-optimized user experience.

Hybrid Apps: May feel less smooth compared to native, though modern frameworks have improved this.

Development Time & Cost

Native Apps: Require separate development for Android and iOS, leading to more time and higher cost.

Hybrid Apps: One codebase works on multiple platforms, saving time and cost.

Access to Device Features

Native Apps: Full access to device features (camera, GPS, sensors, notifications).

Hybrid Apps: Limited or indirect access; may need plugins or APIs.

Updates & Maintenance

Native Apps: Updates must be done separately for each platform.

Hybrid Apps: Easier to maintain since changes can be applied to one codebase.
