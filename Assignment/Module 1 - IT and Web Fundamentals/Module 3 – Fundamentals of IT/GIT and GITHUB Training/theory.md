GIT improves collaboration by acting as a version control system that allows multiple developers to work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. Each team member can create their own branch to add new features or fix bugs independently. Later, these changes can be merged into the main project safely.

It also keeps a complete history of changes, so if something goes wrong, the team can easily roll back to an earlier version. GIT supports parallel development, conflict resolution, and helps in tracking who made which change.

When combined with platforms like GitHub or GitLab, GIT enables pull requests, code reviews, issue tracking, and continuous integration, making teamwork more transparent and efficient.

In short: GIT allows teams to collaborate efficiently, avoid conflicts, maintain code history, and deliver software faster and with fewer errors.
