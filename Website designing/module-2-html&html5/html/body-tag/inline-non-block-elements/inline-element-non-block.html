what is inline-element-non-block ?

inline element-non-block is a type of HTML element that does not create a new line in the document flow. These elements are typically used for formatting text or embedding content without disrupting the layout of surrounding elements. Examples include `<span>`, `<a>`, and `<img>`. Unlike block-level elements, inline elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line.

Inline elements can be styled with CSS, but they do not accept width and height properties in the same way that block-level elements do. Instead, they are affected by properties like `padding`, `margin`, and `font-size`.

Inline elements are often used to apply styles or behaviors to a portion of text or to include small images or links within a paragraph without breaking the flow of the text. They are essential for creating rich, interactive web content while maintaining a clean and organized layout.

examples of non-block elements :


<span>This is an inline element.</span>
<a href="#">This is a link.</a>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image" />
<strong>This text is bold.</strong>

<em>This text is italicized.</em>
<code>This is inline code.</code>
<small>This is small text.</small>
<sub>This is subscript text.</sub>
<sup>This is superscript text.</sup>
