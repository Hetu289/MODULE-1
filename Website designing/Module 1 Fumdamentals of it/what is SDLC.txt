What is SDLC?
Definaton:
SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle. It is a process used by software industry to design, develop, and test high-quality software. The SDLC aims to produce software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, is completed within time and cost estimates, and works efficiently.

Types of SDLC Models and Their Definitions:

1. Waterfall Model:
    - Definition: A linear and sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
    - Example: Building a banking application where requirements are well understood.

2. Agile Model:
    - Definition: An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and customer collaboration.
    - Example: Developing a mobile app with frequently changing requirements.

3. V-Model (Verification and Validation Model):
    - Definition: An extension of the waterfall model where each development stage is associated with a testing phase.
    - Example: Developing safety-critical software for medical devices.

4. Iterative Model:
    - Definition: Software is developed and improved through repeated cycles (iterations).
    - Example: Creating a web-based platform where features are added in each iteration.

5. Spiral Model:
    - Definition: Combines iterative development with systematic aspects of the waterfall model, focusing on risk analysis.
    - Example: Large-scale enterprise software with high risk and complex requirements.

6. Big Bang Model:
    - Definition: Development starts with little planning and resources are allocated as needed; suitable for small projects.
    - Example: Small student projects or proof-of-concept prototypes.
