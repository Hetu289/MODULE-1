Question 3: What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the
advantages and disadvantages of each approach

CSS Types: Internal, External, and Inline

CSS can be added to HTML in three ways: Internal, External, and Inline. Each has its own use, advantages, and disadvantages.

1. Internal CSS

* Definition: CSS is written inside the <style> tag in the <head> section of an HTML file.
* Example:

<head>  
  <style>  
    p {  
      color: blue;  
      font-size: 16px;  
    }  
  </style>  
</head>  
- Advantages:  
  - Easy to manage for a single page.  
  - No external file needed.  
- Disadvantages:  
  - Cannot be reused on other pages.  
  - Makes the HTML file larger.  

2. External CSS

* Definition: CSS is written in a separate .css file and linked to HTML using <link> tag.
* Example:

<head>  
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styles.css">  
</head>  
styles.css content:  
p {  
  color: green;  
  font-size: 18px;  
}  
- Advantages:  
  - Can be reused on multiple pages.  
  - Keeps HTML clean and smaller.  
  - Easier to maintain for large websites.  
- Disadvantages:  
  - Needs an extra HTTP request to load the CSS file.  
  - If the file is missing, styles won’t apply.  

3. Inline CSS

* Definition: CSS is written directly inside an HTML element using the style attribute.
* Example:

<p style="color:red; font-size:20px;">Hello World</p>  
- Advantages:  
  - Quick for testing or overriding other styles.  
  - Useful for one-time changes.  
- Disadvantages:  
  - Cannot be reused.  
  - Makes HTML cluttered and hard to maintain.  
  - Not efficient for large projects.  

In short:
Internal → Easy for single page, not reusable
External → Reusable, maintainable, clean
Inline → Quick, one-time use, not reusable
