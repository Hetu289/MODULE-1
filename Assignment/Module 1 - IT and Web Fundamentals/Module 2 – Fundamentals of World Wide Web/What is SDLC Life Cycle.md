What is SDLC Life Cycle?

SDLC = Software Development Life Cycle.

It is the step-by-step process of developing software or applications.

Ensures software is built in a planned, efficient, and structured way.

Phases of SDLC:

Planning – Define goals, requirements, and feasibility.

Analysis – Gather detailed requirements.

Design – Create system design, database design, UI/UX design.

Development – Write actual code (programming).

Testing – Check for bugs, errors, and security issues.

Implementation/Deployment – Launch the software for users.

Maintenance – Regular updates, bug fixes, improvements.

Example: Developing a mobile app goes through all these steps before it reaches users.
